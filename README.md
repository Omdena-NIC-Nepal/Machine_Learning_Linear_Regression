# Machine Learning Beginner Project: Linear Regression
### Project Title: Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression

**Objective:** To introduce students to supervised learning, focusing on linear regression, by guiding them through a project that predicts house prices based on a variety of features.

**Dataset:** We'll use the "Boston Housing Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about housing in Boston, including features such as the number of rooms, age of the house, and crime rate, along with the target variable, which is the median value of owner-occupied homes.

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
#### **Task 1:** Data Exploration

Notebook: notebooks/EDA.ipynb
Steps:
- Load the dataset.
- Explore the data structure, types, and summary statistics.
- Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
- Identify missing values and outliers.


#### Task 2: Data Preprocessing

Notebook: notebooks/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb
Steps:
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize/standardize numerical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Script: scripts/data_preprocessing.py


### 3. Model Building and Training
#### Task 3: Model Training

Notebook: notebooks/Model_Training.ipynb
Steps:
- Choose appropriate features for the model.
- Train a linear regression model.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (if applicable).

- Script: scripts/train_model.py

### 4. Model Evaluation
#### Task 4: Model Evaluation

Notebook: notebooks/Model_Evaluation.ipynb
Steps:
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.
- Plot residuals to check the assumptions of linear regression.
- Compare model performance with different feature sets or preprocessing steps.
- Script: scripts/evaluate_model.py
### 5. Feature Engineering and Improvement
#### Task 5: Feature Engineering

Notebook: notebooks/Feature_Engineering.ipynb
Steps:
- Create new features that might improve model performance.
- Test different feature combinations.
- Evaluate the impact of new features on model performance.

### 6. Collaboration and Version Control
#### Task 6: Collaboration and Version Control

Steps:
# Ensure each student works on their branch.
- Regularly merge branches after reviewing and resolving conflicts.
- Use pull requests to review and discuss changes before merging.
- Git Commands: Provide a list of essential Git commands for students to use.
